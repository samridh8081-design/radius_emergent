Hello Replit. We have a severe content integrity issue that needs immediate correction. The previous design implementation mistakenly overwrote the original content. This is a top-priority fix.
Your task is to re-insert the ORIGINAL content into the current design structure, ensuring the existing design language (from the most recent successful design pass) remains 100% intact.
I am providing a single image with the EXACT CONTENT that MUST be on the page: Image of Old Content - GeoPulse Landing Page (Reference: Original state with correct text)
This time, focus SOLELY on content replacement, while preserving the existing, correct design.

Absolute Non-Negotiables (Read Carefully):
CONTENT IS THE ONLY FOCUS:
The ONLY change allowed in this prompt is to update the text elements.
DO NOT ALTER ANY CSS STYLING, layout, or design properties.
DO NOT TOUCH the search bar's appearance or functionality.
DO NOT TOUCH the "Age of AI." highlight's appearance.
PRESERVE EXISTING DESIGN: The current visual styling of the navigation bar, headline font-weight, the "Age of AI." liquid glass highlight (black background, white text, subtle shine), the search bar (white background, internal black button, rounded corners), and the sub-headline font/color must be preserved exactly as they are now. You are just replacing the text within these styled elements.
NO FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES: Backend connections and interactive element logic must remain untouched.

Detailed Content Replacement Instructions:
Locate the following elements and replace their text content precisely with the text provided below. Maintain all existing HTML tags (like <span> for the highlight) where they currently exist.
Navigation Links:
Find "Features" and set its text to: Features
Find "Pricing" and set its text to: Pricing
Find "About" and set its text to: About
Find "Login" and set its text to: Login
Find "Get Started" (or "Start Free Trial") and set its text to: Get Started
Ensure this button retains its current styling (black background, white text).
Hero Section - Main Headline:
Find the main headline. It should be currently displaying "Be Found in the Age of AI."
Replace its content to be: Increase your visibility
The words "across AI platforms" should be contained within the existing styled element that currently has the "liquid glass" black highlight.
So, the final structure should be: Increase your visibility <styled_highlight_element>across AI platforms</styled_highlight_element>
Crucially: The across AI platforms text MUST inherit the existing liquid glass black highlight style.
Hero Section - Sub-Headline:
Find the sub-headline. It should be currently displaying "Advanced GEO targeting and optimization tools..."
Replace its content to be: Discover how ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity perceive your brand. Get actionable insights to boost your AI presence.
Ensure this text retains its current styling (medium-gray color, regular font-weight, no underlines).
Search Bar - Placeholder Text:
Find the <input> element within the search bar.
Replace its placeholder attribute's value to be: Enter your website URL (e.g., example.com)
Search Bar - Button Text (if any, or just icon):
The search button currently has only an icon. Maintain the icon. If it implicitly added text, remove it.
Supporting Text Below Search Bar:
This text was missing in the previous version. Please add this below the search bar, styled as a smaller, light-gray text.
Content: No credit card required • Free comprehensive analysis • Results in 30 seconds
Metrics/Social Proof Section (Below Hero):
This section was also missing. Please add this section below the hero area.
Each metric should be bold, with descriptive text in a regular font-weight next to it, matching the subtle styling of the original image.
Content:

To be absolutely clear: The visual outcome should combine the content from the provided old image with the sleek, minimalist black-and-white design (including the black liquid glass highlight and integrated search bar) that you have been working on.
Proceed with extreme caution on content. The design is now established; it's time to accurately populate it.
