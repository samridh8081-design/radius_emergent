Hello Replit. I need to perform a significant UI/UX redesign of my landing page's hero section.
I have a design inspiration attached in the image
Your task is to apply the design language (fonts, colors, shadows, component styles) from the inspiration image to my existing content.
Critical Rules: Read First
DO NOT CHANGE CONTENT: All text on the page must remain as it is in the original code.
The headline is "Be Found in the Age of AI.".
The sub-headline is "Advanced GEO targeting and optimization tools...".
The search bar placeholder is "www.techstartup.io".
Do NOT use any text from the inspiration image (e.g., "Increase your visibility...").
DO NOT ADD/REMOVE SECTIONS: Only restyle existing elements.
Do NOT add the "AI-Powered Visibility Analysis" badge from the inspiration.
Do NOT add the metrics/social proof section ("500+ analyses run...") from the inspiration.
PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY: All backend logic, especially for the search bar form, must remain 100% intact. These changes should be purely in the CSS/styling.

Detailed Design Changes (by Section)
Please implement the following changes precisely:
1. Navigation Bar
Links: Find the existing nav links ("Features", "Pricing", "Resources", "About"). Restyle them to match the inspiration: plain, non-bold, sans-serif text. The color should be a medium-to-dark gray.
CTA Button: Find the existing "Start Free Trial" button. Re-style it to look exactly like the "Get Started" button in the inspiration image:
Background: Solid black (#000 or equivalent).
Text: White.
Padding & Shape: Match the padding and slight border-radius.
2. Hero Section: Headline
This is the most important change.
Main Headline ("Be Found in the"):
Change the font-weight to be heavy and bold, matching the "Increase your visibility" text in the inspiration.
Ensure the color is solid black.
Highlighted Text ("Age of AI."):
Remove the current light-gray background box from behind the words.
Apply a "liquid glass" highlight effect directly to the words "Age of AI."
This new highlight effect should be styled identically to the blue "across AI platforms" highlight in the inspiration image (i.e., same shape, shine, and "liquid" feel).
Crucially: The background color of this new highlight must be black, not blue.
The text "Age of AI." itself must now be white to contrast against its new black highlight.
3. Hero Section: Sub-headline
Text: Target the sub-headline ("Advanced GEO targeting and optimization...").
Styling: Re-style this entire text block to match the gray body text in the inspiration image (like the "Discover how ChatGPT..." text). It should be a standard font-weight and a medium-gray color.
Remove Underline: Remove the simple underline from the words "GEO targeting". The entire sub-headline should have one single, consistent style.
4. Search Bar & Form
Target: Select the entire search bar component (the form/input/button group).
Input Field (<input>):
Re-style the text input to look exactly like the one in the inspiration image.
Background: White.
Placeholder: Keep the existing "www.techstartup.io" placeholder, but style its text color as light gray.
Shadow/Border: Add the subtle, clean box-shadow from the inspiration image to give it depth (e.g., box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);).
Shape: Ensure it has a slight border-radius to match.
Search Button (<button>):
Re-style the search button to match the inspiration image's button.
It must be positioned inside the input field, on the far right.
Background: Solid black.
Icon: The search icon inside must be white.
Shape: It should be a circle or a rounded square to perfectly match the inspiration's search button.
Functionality: Ensure the onClick or onSubmit event handler is unchanged.
