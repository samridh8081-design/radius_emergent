Detailed Replit Prompt for Landing Page Redesign
I need you to redesign the landing page's VISUAL STYLE ONLY to match the design aesthetics shown in the attached screenshot. 

⚠️ IMPORTANT: DO NOT change any text content - keep all existing text exactly as it is. Only update the design, styling, and visual presentation.

## DESIGN-ONLY REQUIREMENTS (Keep All Existing Text)

### 1. NAVIGATION BAR STYLING
**Keep existing text:** "GeoPulse", "Features", "Pricing", "About", "Login", "Get Started"
**Design Changes:**
- Style the logo area with a circular icon/badge on the left (black or dark background)
- Navigation items: Apply gray text color, clean typography
- "Get Started" button: Change to BLACK background with white text
- "Login": Style as simple text link (no button styling)
- Remove all blue colors from navigation
- Use clean, minimal styling

### 2. REMOVE DECORATIVE ELEMENTS
- Remove the floating star/sparkle icon in the top right corner
- Keep the "AI-Powered Visibility Analysis" badge but restyle it (remove blue, use gray/black)
- Clean up any decorative floating elements while keeping informational content

### 3. HERO SECTION HEADING STYLING
**Keep existing text:** "Increase your visibility across AI platforms"
**Design Changes:**
- Apply black color to "Increase your visibility" 
- ADD HIGHLIGHT/UNDERLINE EFFECT to "across AI platforms" part
- Create the underline effect exactly like "GEO targeting" in the reference image:
  ```css
  .highlight-text {
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-color: #3B82F6; /* or use border-bottom */
    text-underline-offset: 4px;
    text-decoration-thickness: 2px;
    color: #3B82F6; /* Keep some blue for the highlighted portion only */
  }

Use very large, bold font
Maintain center alignment
4. SUBHEADING STYLING
Keep existing text: "Discover how ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity perceive your brand. Get actionable insights to boost your AI presence." Design Changes:
Apply gray color (#6B7280)
Clean, readable typography
Center aligned
Appropriate spacing
5. SEARCH BAR REDESIGN
Keep functionality and placeholder text: "Enter your website URL (e.g., example.com)" Design Changes:
WHITE background for input field (not gray)
Add subtle shadow: box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
Rounded corners (8-12px radius)
Make input field wider and more prominent
"Get Instant Results" button:
Change to BLACK background
White text
Rounded corners matching input
Remove arrow icon or make it white
Same height as input field
6. SUPPORTING TEXT STYLING
Keep existing text: "No credit card required • Free comprehensive analysis • Results in 30 seconds" Design Changes:
Style with simple gray text
Clean typography
Proper spacing
7. METRICS SECTION
Keep existing text: "500+ analyses run", "89% avg improvement", "4 AI platforms analyzed" Design Changes:
Remove blue color from numbers
Use black for numbers, gray for descriptive text
Minimal styling
8. COLOR SCHEME
Primary: Black (#000000) for CTAs and important text
Headings: Black with blue ONLY for highlighted/underlined portions
Body Text: Gray (#6B7280)
Backgrounds: White (#FFFFFF)
Accent: Blue (#3B82F6) ONLY for the underline/highlight effect
Remove blue from buttons, badges, and other UI elements
9. SPECIFIC CSS FOR HIGHLIGHT EFFECT
/* Hero Title with Highlight Effect */
.hero-title {
  color: #000000;
  font-weight: 900;
  font-size: 64px;
}

.hero-title .highlight {
  position: relative;
  color: #3B82F6; /* or keep black with colored underline */
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-decoration-color: #3B82F6;
  text-decoration-thickness: 3px;
  text-underline-offset: 6px;
  /* OR use border-bottom approach: */
  /* border-bottom: 3px solid #3B82F6; */
  /* padding-bottom: 4px; */
}

/* Black CTA Button */
.cta-button {
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 14px 28px;
  font-weight: 600;
  border: none;
  transition: transform 0.2s;
}

.cta-button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
}

/* White Search Input */
.search-input {
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
  border: 1px solid #E5E7EB;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);
  padding: 16px 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
}

10. DESIGN INSPIRATION NOTES
Take the minimalist, clean aesthetic from the reference image
Implement the professional black and white color scheme
Add the underline/highlight effect for emphasis (like "GEO targeting" in reference)
Create high contrast between elements
Remove gradients and excessive decorations
Focus on typography and spacing
REMEMBER:
DO NOT change any website content or text
ONLY update the visual design, colors, and styling
Keep all existing functionality
The highlight/underline effect should be applied to "across AI platforms" to create visual emphasis like in the reference image
The goal is to transform the current blue-heavy design into a sophisticated black and white design with strategic highlighting, while maintaining all the original content and messaging.
