I'll create a detailed prompt for Replit to build the first section of your GEO optimization tool landing page. Since I don't see the screenshot you mentioned, I'll create a comprehensive prompt based on typical SaaS landing page patterns with a search/analysis feature.

## Detailed Replit Prompt for GEO Optimization Tool Landing Page

```
Create a modern, professional landing page for a GEO Optimization SaaS tool with the following specifications:

## PROJECT SETUP
- Use Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Icons: Lucide React or Heroicons
- Font: Inter or similar modern sans-serif

## FIRST SECTION - HERO WITH ANALYSIS SEARCH

### Layout Structure:
1. **Navigation Bar** (fixed, glass-morphism effect):
   - Logo on left: "GeoOptimizer" or placeholder
   - Center nav items: Features, Pricing, Resources, About
   - Right side: "Login" button (ghost) and "Get Started" button (primary)
   - Mobile responsive with hamburger menu

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Full viewport height (100vh)
   - Background: Gradient mesh or subtle geometric pattern (blues/purples)
   
   **Content Layout:**
   - Headline: Large, bold text (56-72px desktop, 36-48px mobile)
     "Optimize Your Website for Global Performance"
   - Subheadline: (20-24px, muted color)
     "Analyze and improve your site's geographical optimization in seconds"
   
   **Search/Analysis Component** (Main Focus):
   - Large, prominent search bar container with:
     - Input field with placeholder: "Enter your website URL (e.g., example.com)"
     - Search/Analyze button (primary color, animated on hover)
     - Below search: Small text "No credit card required • Free analysis"
   
   **Visual Elements**:
   - Floating badges showing metrics: "500ms faster", "89% improvement", "Global CDN"
   - Subtle animations on scroll
   - Optional: World map dots or connection lines in background

### Technical Implementation:

**Search Functionality Integration:**
```javascript
// Connect the search input to existing analysis logic
const handleAnalysis = async (url) => {
  // Validate URL
  if (!isValidUrl(url)) {
    showError("Please enter a valid URL");
    return;
  }
  
  // Show loading state
  setIsAnalyzing(true);
  
  try {
    // Call existing analysis endpoint/function
    const results = await analyzeWebsite(url);
    
    // Redirect to results page or show inline results
    router.push(`/analysis?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`);
  } catch (error) {
    showError("Analysis failed. Please try again.");
  } finally {
    setIsAnalyzing(false);
  }
};
```

### Design Specifications:

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: #4F46E5 (Indigo)
- Secondary: #7C3AED (Purple)
- Accent: #06B6D4 (Cyan)
- Background: #FFFFFF with gradient overlays
- Text: #1F2937 (dark), #6B7280 (muted)

**Component States:**
- Search input: Focus state with glow effect
- Button: Hover state with scale transform
- Loading state: Skeleton loader or spinning indicator
- Error state: Red border with error message below

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

**Animations:**
- Fade-in on page load
- Subtle parallax on scroll
- Micro-interactions on hover
- Loading spinner during analysis

### Additional Features:
1. Real-time URL validation
2. Recent searches (stored in localStorage)
3. Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to analyze)
4. Copy-paste functionality
5. URL format auto-correction (adds https:// if missing)

### File Structure:
```
/components
  /Hero
    - HeroSection.tsx
    - SearchBar.tsx
    - NavigationBar.tsx
/lib
  - analysis.ts (connect to existing logic)
  - validation.ts
/styles
  - globals.css
/pages or /app
  - page.tsx (main landing)
  - analysis/page.tsx (results)
```

### Performance Requirements:
- Lighthouse score > 90
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Lazy load images
- Optimize fonts
- Minimize JavaScript bundle

IMPORTANT: The search functionality should seamlessly integrate with the existing website analysis logic that's already implemented. The search bar should trigger the same analysis function that's currently being used, just with a new UI wrapper.

Make the design modern, clean, and conversion-focused. Use subtle gradients, smooth animations, and ensure excellent UX with clear CTAs and intuitive navigation.

This prompt will give Replit's AI a clear direction to create the first section of your landing page with the search/analysis functionality integrated. Once this section is complete, we can move on to additional sections step by step.

Would you like me to adjust any specific aspects of this prompt, or would you prefer to share the screenshot so I can make it more precise to your exact design?
